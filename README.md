# Quickly GraphQL Server

(**WIP**) Use TypeScript to quickly build a GraphQL server, especially for CRUD functions, almost without writing code.

Minimal code, flexible CRUD API.

## Principles

This project is built with the following principles in mind:

- Practical: everything with practical as the main purpose;
- Simple: Keep it simple, easy to maintain and implement.

## TODO

- [ ] upgrade to graphql 16.x

  > [Fix for graphql 16: GraphQLNonNull cannot be invoked without 'new'](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/issues/1009)

- [ ] create dev documents
